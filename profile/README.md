Welcome to YAKE!

YAKE is a GitOps driven installer and lifecycle management tool for [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud).

It helps you to deploy your [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud) setup fast and reliably.
It is also your companion, when it comes to upgrading and maintaining your setup. All
YAKE releases are carefully selected and tested sets of upstream
[Gardener](https://gardener.cloud) components. With YAKE you can run and
configure your complete [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud) setup through your Git
configuration repository. Based on [Flux](https://fluxcd.io), the actual state of the
system is always reconciled to the declarative configuration from your Git repository
which results in full control of your [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud) installation.
